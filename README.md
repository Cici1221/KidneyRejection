## KidneyRejection
# DATA3888 assignment 2
A successful kidney transplantation improves survival and quality of life, yet the allocation of decreased donor kidneys is a problem since these organs are a limited resource.

The allocation should satisfy both maximum utility such as graft years and survival rate, and equity between different groups. A better match between kidney and patients could be achieved through the understanding and prediction of kidney transplant rejection from analysis of RNA-seq data GSE120396.
